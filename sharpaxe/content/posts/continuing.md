This is a blog of an individual who strives to get good at something. I believe that being good at something is a purpose of a human. We admire competence, sharpness, dedication to one's craft. We admire people who are **good** at something. We admire people who are good at something. 
There is no end goal in being good. Being good is not a destination, it is rather an intention. It is part of the spirit. It is something that puts us in a continuous state of unfinished business. 
For me, being good, or rather _becoming good_ is a source of meaning. 

I want to be good at several things, one of them is software engineering. This is what I picked as my craft. And this is what I will write about. 

In this blog, I plan to write notes to myself. Many of notes will be about trivia, fundamentals, and obvious things - a conspectus to organize my knowledge. Some of the notes will be about interesting ways to view the things, about my ideas and observations. This blog is a tool at becoming good. 

This is not a beginning of the journey but its continuation.
