There is no end goal in being good. Being good is not a destination, it is rather an intention. It is part of the spirit. It is something that puts us in a continuous state of unfinished business.
For me, being good, or rather <em>becoming good</em> is a source of meaning.</p>
<p>I want to be good at several things, one of them is software engineering. This is what I picked as my craft. And this is what I will write about.</p>
<p>In this blog, I plan to write notes to myself. Many of notes will be about trivia, fundamentals, and obvious things - a conspectus to organize my knowledge. Some of the notes will be about interesting ways to view the things, about my ideas and observations. This blog is a tool at becoming good.</p>
<p>This is not a beginning of the journey but its continuation.</p>
